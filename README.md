# Rectangle Mouse-Tracking Animation

This project demonstrates a smooth rectangle animation using GSAP where a rectangle follows the mouse cursor horizontally across the screen.

## 🚀 Features

- Centered Rectangle: A styled rectangle placed in the middle of the viewport.

- Mouse Tracking: The rectangle moves left and right based on the cursor’s horizontal position.

- Smooth Animation: Powered by GSAP’s tweening and easing (Power3).

- Responsive Range Mapping: Uses gsap.utils.mapRange() to constrain movement within screen boundaries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 for structure

- CSS3 for styling (shadows, rounded corners, layout)

- JavaScript (ES6) for interactivity

- GSAP 3 for animation
